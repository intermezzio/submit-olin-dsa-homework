# Submit Olin DSA Homework

This script signs into canvas for you and submits
your GitHub repository for all upcoming canvas assignments.

Run it using `python submit.py`

The only requirement is selenium for Python,
although if you want it to run on a schedule
(linux only) you can make a crontab as well.
To make your computer run this script using crontab
every 3 days, run `python .`
